This is the explanation of the GUI of the ELOG to be created.

PART 1
-> We need to create home page UI which allows you to input details about different shifts and gives 
   features to operate through it. We just need streamlit to produce the home page. 
-> The features we need to create for the home page:
     1. Shift detail - Time and Date (date and time input)
     2. Operator name - Name of the operator who takes care of the various operations (text input)
     3. Operation type - Type of Operation to be performed
     4. Observational Entry - A mutable table that can be used to store the outputs of the experiments 
                              performed.
     5. Instruction for the next shift - This feature adds gives instruction for the next shift about any
                                         abnormalities in the processes.
Note: The instruction of the previous shift has to be shown on the top.

-> The next operator can visit the previous shift's details or can create a new sheet to push a new entry.

PART 2
-> This page will be in another tab. This page will allow you to enter other finalized outputs. It will be 
   in a form of a table. 
-> It will also have a table for changes and modifications.
-> It will have a text area to add comments for each input.
-> We will have a submit, lock and reset button.
